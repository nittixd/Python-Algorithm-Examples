# Python Algorithm Examples

## Description

This repository contains a collection of Python implementations for various algorithms and coding challenges. These examples cover a range of topics, including mathematical operations, problem-solving techniques, and basic algorithmic patterns. The purpose of this repository is to showcase different ways to tackle common coding problems, serving as a portfolio of essential exercises.

## Contents

- **Pangram Checker**: A function to determine if a given sentence contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.
- **Collatz Conjecture**: A function to calculate the number of steps required to reduce a number to 1 using the Collatz sequence.
- **Grains on a Chessboard**: Functions to calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard square, and the total number of grains on the board.
- **Triangle Types**: Functions to determine if a set of side lengths form a valid triangle and classify it as equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

## Getting Started

Each algorithm or problem-solving exercise is contained within its own file. To run any of the examples, simply clone the repository and execute the desired Python script using a Python interpreter.

### Example

To run the Pangram Checker:

```bash
python pangram_checker.py
